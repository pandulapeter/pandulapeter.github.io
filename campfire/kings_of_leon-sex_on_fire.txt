{c: Intro}

{c: Verse 1}
Lay where you're laying,
Don't make a sound,
I know they're watching,
They're watching.

{c: Verse 2}
All the commotion,
The kiddie-like play,
Has people talking,
They're talking.

{c: Chorus 1}
You, your sex is on fire!

{c: Verse 3}
The dark of the alley,
The breaking of day,
Head while I'm driving,
I'm driving.

{c: Verse 4}
Soft lips are open,
Them knuckles are pale,
Feels like you're dying,
You're dying.

{c: Chorus 1}
You, your sex is on fire!

{c: Chorus 2}
Consumed with what's just transpired.

{c: Verse 5}
Hot as a fever,
Rattling bones,
I could just taste it,
Chased it.

{c: Verse 6}
But it's not forever,
But it's just tonight,
Oh, we're still the greatest,
The greatest, the greatest.

{c: Chorus 1}
And you, your sex is on fire!

{c: Chorus 1}
You, your sex is on fire!

{c: Chorus 2}
Consumed with what's just transpired.

{c: Chorus 1}
And you, your sex is on fire!

{c: Chorus 2}
Consumed with what's just transpired.
