[F#m]            [C#m7]            [Bm]            [D]

{c: Verse 1}
You can tell by the [F#m]way
She walks that she's my [C#m7]girl.
You can tell by the [Bm]way
She talks she woos the [D]world.

{c: Verse 2}
You can see in her [F#m]eyes,
That no one is her [C#m7]change.
She's my [Bm]girl,
My super[D]girl.

{c: Chorus 1}
And then she'd [A]say it's OK,
I got [E]lost on the way,
But I'm a super[F#m]girl,
And supergirls don't [D]cry.

{c: Chorus 2}
And then she'd [A]say it's alright,
I got [E]home late last night,
But I'm a super[F#m]girl,
And supergirls just [D]fly.

{c: Verse 3}
And then she'd [F#m]say
That nothing can go [C#m7]wrong,
When you're in [Bm]love,
What can go [D]wrong?

{c: Verse 4}
And then she'd [F#m]laugh
The night time into [C#m7]day,
Pushing her [Bm]fear,
Further a[D]lone.

{c: Chorus 1}
And then she'd [A]say it's OK,
I got [E]lost on the way,
But I'm a super[F#m]girl,
And supergirls don't [D]cry.

{c: Chorus 2}
And then she'd [A]say it's alright,
I got [E]home late last night,
But I'm a super[F#m]girl,
And supergirls just [D]fly.

{c: Chorus 3}
And then she'd [A]shout, down the line,
Tell me she's [E]got no more time,
'Cause she's a super[F#m]girl,
And supergirl's don't [D]cry.

{c: Chorus 4}
And then she'd [A]scream in my face,
Tell me to [E]leave, leave this place,
'Cause she's a super[F#m]girl,
And supergirl's just [D]fly.

{c: Outro}
Yeah she's a super[A]girl,
A super[E]girl,
She's so in [F#m]seeds, she's burning streams,
She's so in [D]seeds, she's burning trees,
Yeah she's a super[A]girl!
A super[E]girl!
A super[F#m]girl!
My super[D]girl!
[F#m]
