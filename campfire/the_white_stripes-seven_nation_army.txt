{c: Verse 1}
I'm gonna fight 'em all,
A seven nation army couldn't hold me back!
They're gonna rip it off,
Taking their time right behind my back.

{c: Verse 2}
And I'm talking to myself at night,
Because I can't forget.
Back and forth through my mind,
Behind a cigarette.

{c: Pre-Chorus}
And the message coming from my eyes,
Says, "Leave it alone"!

{c: Verse 3}
Don't wanna hear about it,
Every single one's got a story to tell.
Everyone knows about it,
From the Queen of England to the Hounds of Hell.

{c: Verse 4}
And if I catch it coming back my way,
I'm gonna serve it to you.
And that ain't what you want to hear,
But that's what I'll do.

{c: Pre-Chorus}
And the feeling coming from my bones,
Says, "Find a home"!

{c: Verse 5}
I'm going to Wichita,
Far from this opera forevermore.
I'm gonna work the straw,
Make the sweat drip out of every pore.

{c: Verse 6}
And I'm bleeding, and I'm bleeding, and I'm bleeding,
Right before the Lord.
All the words are gonna bleed from me,
And I will sing no more.

{c: Pre-Chorus}
And the stains coming from my blood,
Tell me, "Go back home"!
