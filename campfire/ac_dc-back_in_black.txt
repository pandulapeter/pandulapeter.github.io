{c: Intro}

{c: Verse 1}
Back in black,
I hit the sack,
I've been too long, I'm glad to be back,
Yes, I'm let loose,
From the noose,
That's kept me hanging about.

{c: Verse 2}
I've been looking at the sky,
'Cause it's gettin' me high,
Forget the hearse 'cause I never die.
I got nine lives,
Cat's eyes,
Abusin' every one of them and running wild!

{c: Chorus}
'Cause I'm back, yes, I'm back,
Well, I'm back, yes, I'm back!
Well, I'm back, back,
Well, I'm back in black,
Yes, I'm back in black!

{c: Verse 3}
Back in the back
Of a Cadillac,
Number one with a bullet, I'm a power pack.
Yes, I'm in a bang,
With a gang,
They've got to catch me if they want me to hang.

{c: Verse 4}
'Cause I'm back on the track
And I'm beatin' the flack,
Nobody's gonna get me on another rap.
So look at me now,
I'm just makin' my play,
Don't try to push your luck, just get out of my way!

{c: Chorus}
'Cause I'm back, yes, I'm back,
Well, I'm back, yes, I'm back!
Well, I'm back, back,
Well, I'm back in black,
Yes, I'm back in black!

{c: Solo 1}

{c: Chorus}
Well, I'm back, yes, I'm back,
Well, I'm back, yes, I'm back!
Well, I'm back, back,
Well, I'm back in black,
Yes, I'm back in black!

{c: Solo 2}

{c: Outro}
Well, I'm back (I'm back), back (I'm back),
Back (I'm back), back (I'm back),
Back (I'm back), back,
Back in black,
Yes, I'm back in black!
