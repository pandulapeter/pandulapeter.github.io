{c: Intro}
[A]      [C#m]      [F#m]      [D]

{c: Verse 1}
I [A]heard, that you're [C#m]settled down,
That you [F#m]found a girl and you're, [D]married now.

{c: Verse 2}
[A]I heard, that your [C#m]dreams came true,
Guess she [F#m]gave you things I didn't [D]give to you.

{c: Verse 3}
Ol[A]d friend, why are you [C#m]so shy?
Ain't like [F#m]you to hold back or [D]hide from the light.

{c: Pre-Chorus}
I [E]hate to turn up out of the [F#m]blue uninvited,
But I [D]couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it.
I had [E]hoped you'd see my face,
And [F#m]that you be reminded that for [D]me it isn't over.

{c: Chorus}
[A]Never mind I'll [E]find someone like [F#m]you,   [D]
I wish [A]nothing but the [E]best for [F#m]you [D]two,
Don't for[A]get me, I [E]beg, I'll re[F#m]member you [D]said,
"Sometimes it [A]lasts in love, but [E]sometimes it hurts in[F#m]stead,   [D]
Sometimes it [A]lasts in love, but [E]sometimes it hurts in[F#m]stead, [D]yeah."

{c: Verse 4}
[A]You know how the [C#m]time flies,
Only [F#m]yesterday it was the [D]time of our lives.

{c: Verse 5}
We were [A]born and raised in a [C#m]summer haze,
Bound [F#m]by the surprise of our [D]glory days.

{c: Pre-Chorus}
I [E]hate to turn up out of the [F#m]blue uninvited,
But I [D]couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it.
I had [E]hoped you'd see my face,
And [F#m]that you be reminded that for [D]me it isn't over.

{c: Chorus}
[A]Never mind I'll [E]find someone like [F#m]you,   [D]
I wish [A]nothing but the [E]best for [F#m]you [D]two,
Don't for[A]get me, I [E]beg, I'll re[F#m]member you [D]said,
"Sometimes it [A]lasts in love, but [E]sometimes it hurts in[F#m]stead, [D]yeah."

{c: Bridge}
[E]Nothing compares, no worries or cares,
Reg[F#m]rets and mistakes their memories made.
[D]Who would have known, how bitter[Bm]sweet,
[A]This would [D]taste?

{c: Chorus}
[A]Never mind I'll [E]find someone like [F#m]you,   [D]
I wish [A]nothing but the [E]best for [F#m]you,   [D]
Don't for[A]get me, I [E]beg, I'll re[F#m]member you [D]said,
"Sometimes it [A]lasts in love, but [E]sometimes it hurts in[F#m]stead."   [D]

{c: Chorus}
[A]Never mind I'll [E]find someone like [F#m]you,   [D]
I wish [A]nothing but the [E]best for [F#m]you [D]two,
Don't for[A]get me, I [E]beg, I'll re[F#m]member you [D]said,
"Sometimes it [A]lasts in love, but [E]sometimes it hurts in[F#m]stead,   [D]
Sometimes it [A]lasts in love, but [E]sometimes it hurts in[F#m]stead, [D]yeah."
