{c: Intro}
Shot through the heart and you're to blame,
Darlin', you give love a bad name!

{c: Bridge}

{c: Verse 1}
An angel's smile is what you sell,
You promise me Heaven, then put me through hell.
Chains of love got a hold on me,
When passion's a prison, you can't break free.

{c: Pre-Chorus}
Oh, you're a loaded gun, yeah!
Oh, there's nowhere to run,
No one can save me,
The damage is done!

{c: Chorus}
Shot through the heart and you're to blame,
You give love a bad name (bad name)!
I play my part and you play your game,
You give love a bad name (bad name)!
Hey, you give love,
A bad name!

{c: Bridge}

{c: Verse 2}
Paint your smile on your lips,
Blood red nails on your fingertips.
A school boy's dream, you act so shy,
Your very first kiss was your first kiss goodbye.

{c: Pre-Chorus}
Whoa, you're a loaded gun!
Whoa, there's nowhere to run,
No one can save me,
The damage is done!

{c: Chorus}
Shot through the heart and you're to blame,
You give love a bad name (bad name)!
I play my part and you play your game,
You give love a bad name (bad name)!
You give love...

{c: Solo}

{c: Chorus}
Oh, shot through the heart and you're to blame,
You give love a bad name!
I play my part and you play your game,
You give love a bad name (bad name)!

{c: Chorus}
Shot through the heart and you're to blame,
You give love a bad name (bad name)!
I play my part and you play your game,
You give love a bad name (bad name)!

{c: Outro}
You give love,
You give love
A bad name!

You give love,
You give love
A bad name!

You give love,
You give love
A bad name!

You give love,
You give love
A bad name!
