{c: Verse 1}
[Am]Now that I've [D7]lost everything to [G]you,
You say you [Cmaj7]want to start something [F]new,
And it's [Dm]breaking my heart you're [E]leaving,
Baby, I'm grieving.

{c: Pre-Chorus 1}
[Am]But if you want to [D7]leave, take good [G]care,
Hope you have a [Cmaj7]lot of nice things to [F]wear,
But then a [Dm]lot of nice things turn [E]bad out [G7]there.

{c: Chorus}
[C]Oh, [G]baby, baby, it's a [F]wild world,
[G]It's hard to get [F]by just upon a [C]smile.

[G]I'll always re[F]member you like a [C]child, girl.   [Dm]    [E]

{c: Verse 2}
[Am]You know, I've seen a [D7]lot of what the world can [G]do,
And it's [Cmaj7]breaking my heart in [F]two,
'Cause I [Dm]never want to see you [E]sad girl,
Don't be a bad girl.

{c: Pre-Chorus 2}
[Am]But if you want to [D7]leave, take good [G]care,
Hope you make a lot of [Cmaj7]nice friends out [F]there,
But just re[Dm]member there's a lot of bad, [E]and be[G7]ware,
Beware.

[C]Oh, [G]baby, baby, it's a [F]wild world,
[G]It's hard to get [F]by just upon a [C]smile.
