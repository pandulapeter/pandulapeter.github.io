{c: Verse 1}
They're gonna [E5]clean up your looks,
With all the [E5]lies in the books,
To make a [E5]citizen out of [B5]you.
Because they [A5]sleep with a gun,
And keep an [E5]eye on you, son,
So they can [B5]watch all the things you [E5]do.

{c: Verse 2}
Because the [E5]drugs never work,
They're gonna [E5]give you a smirk,
'Cause they got [E5]methods of keeping you [B5]clean.
They're gonna [A5]rip up your heads,
Your aspi[E5]rations to shreds,
Another [B5]cog in the murder ma[E5]chine.

{c: Chorus}
They said, "All [E5]teenagers scare the livin' [E5]shit out of me",
[E5]They could care less as long as [B5]someone'll bleed,
So [A5]darken your clothes, or strike a [E5]violent pose,
Maybe they'll [B5]leave you alone, but not [E5]me.

{c: Verse 3}
The boys and [E5]girls in the clique,
The awful [E5]names that they stick,
You're never [E5]gonna fit in much, [B5]kid.
But if you're [A5]troubled and hurt,
What you got [E5]under your shirt,
Will make them [B5]pay for the things that they [E5]did.

{c: Chorus}
They said, "All [E5]teenagers scare the livin' [E5]shit out of me",
[E5]They could care less as long as [B5]someone'll bleed,
So [A5]darken your clothes, or strike a [E5]violent pose,
Maybe they'll [B5]leave you alone, but not [E5]me.
Oh, yeah!

{c: Solo}
[A5]        [A5]        [E5]        [E5]
[A5]        [A5]        [B5]        [B5]

{c: Chorus}
They said, "All [-]teenagers scare the livin' shit out of me",
They could care less as long as someone'll bleed,
So darken your clothes, or strike a violent pose,
Maybe they'll leave you alone, but not me.
All together now!

{c: Chorus}
They said, "All [E5]teenagers scare the livin' [E5]shit out of me",
[E5]They could care less as long as [B5]someone'll bleed,
