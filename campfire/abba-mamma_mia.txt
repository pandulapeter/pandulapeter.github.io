{c: Verse 1}
[D]I've been cheated by you since I don't know [G]when,
[D]So I made up my mind, it must come to an [G]end.
[D]Look at me now, [Daug]will I ever learn,
[D]I don't know [Daug]how, but I suddenly [G]lose control,
There's a fire with[A]in my soul.

{c: Pre-Chorus}
[G]Just [D]one [A]look and I can hear a bell ring
[G]One [D]more [A]look and I forget everything, whoa.

{c: Chorus 1}
[D]Mamma mia, here I go again,
[G]My, my, how can I resist you?
[D]Mamma mia, does it show again,
[G]My, my, just how much I've missed you?

{c: Chorus 2}
[D]Yes, I've been [A/C#]brokenhearted,
[Bm]Blue since the [F#m/A]day we parted,  [G]
[C]Why, [G]why [Em]did I ever [A]let you go?

{c: Post-Chorus}
[D]Mamma mia, [Bm]now I really know,  [G]
[C]My, [G]my, [Em]I could never [A]let you go!

{c: Verse 2}
[D]I've been angry and sad about things that you [G]do,
[D]I can't count all the times that I've told you we're [G]through.
[D]And when you go, [Daug]when you slam the door,
[D]I think you know [Daug]that you won't be a[G]way too long,
You know that I'm [A]not that strong.

[D]Mamma mia, even if I say,  [G]
[C]Bye-[G]bye, leave me now or never.

[D]Mamma mia, it's a game we play,  [G]
[C]Bye-[G]bye doesn't mean forever.

[D]Mamma mia, here I go again,  [G]
