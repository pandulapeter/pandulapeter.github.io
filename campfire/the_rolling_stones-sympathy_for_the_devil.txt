{c: Verse 1}
[E]Please allow me to intro[D]duce myself,
I'm a [A]man of wealth and [E]taste.
[E]I've been around for a [D]long, long year,
Stole [A]many a man's soul to [E]waste.
[E]And I was 'round when [D]Jesus Christ
Had his [A]moment of doubt and [E]pain.
[E]Made damn sure that [D]Pilate
Washed his [A]hands and sealed his [E]fate.

{c: Chorus}
[B]Pleased to meet you,
[B]Hope you guess my [E]name.
But what's [B]puzzling you
Is the [B]nature of my [E]game.

{c: Verse 2}
[E]I stuck around St. [D]Petersburg
When I [A]saw it was a time for a [E]change.
[E]Killed the czar and his [D]ministers,
Anas[A]tasia screamed in [E]vain.
[E]I rode a tank, held a [D]general's rank
When the [A]blitzkrieg raged and the [E]bodies stank.

{c: Chorus}
[B]Pleased to meet you,
[B]Hope you guess my [E]name, oh yeah.
Ah, what's [B]puzzling you
Is the [B]nature of my [E]game, oh yeah.

{c: Verse 3}
[E]I watched with glee while your [D]kings and queens
Fought for [A]ten decades for the [E]gods they made.
I [E]shouted out, \"Who killed the [D]Kennedys?\"
When [A]after all it was [E]you and me.
[E]So let me please intro[D]duce myself,
I'm a [A]man of wealth and [E]taste.
[E]And I laid traps for [D]troubadours,
Who get [A]killed before they reached Bom[E]bay.

{c: Chorus}
[B]Pleased to meet you,
[B]Hope you guessed my [E]name, oh yeah.
But what's [B]puzzling you
Is the [B]nature of my [E]game, oh yeah, get down, baby!

{c: Verse 4}
Just as [E]every cop is a [D]criminal
And [A]all the sinners [E]saints.
As [E]heads is tails, just call me [D]Lucifer,
'Cause I'm in [A]need of some rest[E]raint.
So if you [E]meet me, have some [D]courtesy,
Have some [A]sympathy, and some [E]taste.
Use [E]all your well-learned [D]politesse
Or I'll [A]lay your soul to [E]waste!
