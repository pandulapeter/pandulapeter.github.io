{c: Intro}
[E]        [B7]        [E]        [E]

{c: Verse 1}
[E]Goodbye Norma Jean,
Though I never [A]knew you at all,
You had the grace to [E]hold yourself,
While those around you [A]crawled.

{c: Verse 2}
They crawled out of the [E]woodwork,
And they whispered [A]into your brain,
They set you on the [E]treadmill,
And they made you change your [A]name.

{c: Chorus}
And it [B]seems to me, you lived your life
Like a [E]candle in the [A]wind.
Never [E]knowing who to cling to
When the [B]rain set in,
And [A]I would have liked to have [B]known you,
But I was [C#m]just a kid,
Your candle burned out [B]long before
Your [A]legend ever did.   [E]

{c: Bridge}
[B]        [A]        [E]        [B]

{c: Verse 3}
[E]Loneliness was tough,
The toughest role [A]you ever played,
Hollywood created a [E]superstar,
And pain was the price you [A]paid.

{c: Verse 4}
Even when you [E]died,
Oh, the press still [A]hounded you,
All the papers [E]had to say,
Was that Marilyn was fo[A]und in the nude.

{c: Chorus}
And it [B]seems to me, you lived your life
Like a [E]candle in the [A]wind.
Never [E]knowing who to cling to
When the [B]rain set in,
And [A]I would have liked to have [B]known you,
But I was [C#m]just a kid,
Your candle burned out [B]long before
Your [A]legend ever did.   [E]

{c: Bridge}
[B]        [A]        [E]        [B]

{c: Verse 1}
[E]Goodbye Norma Jean,
Though I never [A]knew you at all,
You had the grace to [E]hold yourself,
While those around you [A]crawled.

{c: Verse 5}
[E]Goodbye Norma Jean,
From the young man in the [A]twenty second row,
Who sees you as something [E]more than sexual,
More than just our Mari[A]lyn Monroe.

{c: Chorus}
And it [B]seems to me, you lived your life
Like a [E]candle in the [A]wind.
Never [E]knowing who to cling to
When the [B]rain set in,
And [A]I would have liked to have [B]known you,
But I was [C#m]just a kid,
Your candle burned out [B]long before
Your [A]legend ever did.   [E]

{c: Outro}
Your candle burned out [B]long before
Your [A]legend ever did.   [E]
