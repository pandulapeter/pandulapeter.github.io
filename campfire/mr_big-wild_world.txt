{c: Intro}
[Dm]La, la, la, la, [G7]la, la, la, la, la, [C]la,
La, la, [Fmaj7]la, la, la, la, la, [A#]la,
La, la, [Gm]la, la, la, la, la, [A]la, la.

{c: Verse 1}
[Dm]Now that I've [G7]lost everything to [C]you,
You say you [Fmaj7]want to start something [A#]new,
And it's [Gm]breaking my heart you're [A]leaving,
Baby, I'm grieving.

{c: Pre-Chorus 1}
[Dm]But if you want to [G7]leave, take good [C]care,
Hope you have a [Fmaj7]lot of nice things to [A#]wear,
But then a [Gm]lot of nice things turn [A]bad out [C7]there.

{c: Chorus}
[F]Oh, [C]baby, baby, it's a [A#]wild world,
[C]It's hard to get [A#]by just upon a [F]smile.
[F]Oh, [C]baby, baby, it's a [A#]wild world,
[C]I'll always re[A#]member you like a [F]child, girl.   [Gm]        [A]

{c: Verse 2}
[Dm]You know, I've seen a [G7]lot of what the world can [C]do,
And it's [Fmaj7]breaking my heart in [A#]two,
'Cause I [Gm]never want to see you [A]sad girl,
Don't be a bad girl.

{c: Pre-Chorus 2}
[Dm]But if you want to [G7]leave, take good [C]care,
Hope you make a lot of [Fmaj7]nice friends out [A#]there,
But just re[Gm]member there's a lot of bad, [A]and be[C7]ware,
Beware.

{c: Chorus}
[F]Oh, [C]baby, baby, it's a [A#]wild world,
[C]It's hard to get [A#]by just upon a [F]smile.
[F]Oh, [C]baby, baby, it's a [A#]wild world,
And I'll [C]always re[A#]member you like a [F]child, girl.   [Gm]        [A]

{c: Solo}

La, la, la, la, [Fmaj7]la, la, la, la, la, [A#]la,
La, la, la, la, [Gm]la, la, la, la, la, [A]la, la.
Baby I love you.

{c: Pre-Chorus 2}
[Dm]But if you want to [G7]leave, take good [C]care,
Hope you make a lot of [Fmaj7]nice friends out [A#]there,

And I'll [C]always re[A#]member you like a [F]child, girl.
