[Am]

{c: Verse 1}
She [Am]came to me one morning,
One [Am]lonely Sunday morning,
Her [G]long hair flowing in the
[Am]Mid-winter wind.

{c: Verse 2}
I [Am]know not how she found me,
For in [Am]darkness I was walking,
And des[G]truction lay around me,
From a [Am]fight I could not win.

{c: Chorus}
[Am]Ah, ah, [G]ah, [Am]ah.
Ah, [G]ah, [Am]ah.

{c: Bridge}
[Am]

{c: Verse 3}
She [Am]asked me name my foe then,
I [Am]said the need within some men
To [G]fight and kill their brothers,
Without [Am]thought of men or God.

{c: Verse 4}
And I [Am]begged her give me horses,
To [Am]trample down my enemies,
So [G]eager was my passion
To de[Am]vour this waste of life.

{c: Chorus}
[Am]Ah, ah, [G]ah, [Am]ah.
Ah, [G]ah, [Am]ah.

{c: Verse 5}
But she [Am]would not think of battle that,
Re[Am]duces men to animals,
So [G]easy to begin and yet
Im[Am]possible to end.

{c: Verse 6}
For [Am]she the mother of all men,
Had [Am]counciled me so wisely that
I [G]feared to walk alone again
And [Am]asked if she would stay.

{c: Chorus}
[Am]Ah, ah, [G]ah, [Am]ah.
Ah, [G]ah, [Am]ah.

{c: Verse 7}
"Oh, [Am]lady, lend your hand," I cried,
"Oh, [Am]let me rest here at your side."
"Have [G]faith and trust in me," she said,
And [Am]filled my heart with life.

{c: Verse 8}
There [Am]is no strength in numbers,
I've [Am]no such misconceptions,
But [G]when you need me, be assured,
I [Am]won't be far away.

{c: Chorus}
[Am]Ah, ah, [G]ah, [Am]ah.
Ah, [G]ah, [Am]ah.

{c: Verse 9}
Thus [Am]having spoke she turned away,
And [Am]though I found no words to say,
I [G]stood and watched until I saw her
[Am]Black cloak disappear.

{c: Verse 10}
My [Am]labor is no easier,
But [Am]now I know I'm not alone,
I [G]find new heart each time I think
U[Am]pon that windy day.

{c: Verse 11}
And [Am]if one day she comes to you,
Drink [Am]deeply from her words so wise,
Take [G]courage from her as your prize
And [Am]say hello for me.

{c: Chorus}
[Am]Ah, ah, [G]ah, [Am]ah.
Ah, [G]ah, [Am]ah.

{c: Chorus}
[Am]Ah, ah, [G]ah, [Am]ah.
Ah, [G]ah, [Am]ah.

[Am]Ah, ah, [G]ah, [Am]ah.
Ah, [G]ah, [Am]ah.

{c: Chorus}
[Am]Ah, ah, [G]ah, [Am]ah.
Ah, [G]ah, [Am]ah.

{c: Chorus}
[Am]Ah, ah, [G]ah, [Am]ah.
Ah, [G]ah, [Am]ah.

{c: Chorus}
[Am]Ah, ah, [G]ah, [Am]ah.
Ah, [G]ah, [Am]ah.

{c: Chorus}
[Am]Ah, ah, [G]ah, [Am]ah.
Ah, [G]ah, [Am]ah.

{c: Chorus}
[Am]Ah, ah, [G]ah, [Am]ah.
Ah, [G]ah, [Am]ah.
