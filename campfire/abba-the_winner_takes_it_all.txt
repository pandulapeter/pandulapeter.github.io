{c: Verse 1}
I don't wanna [F#]talk,
About [C#/F]things we've gone through,
Though it's hurting [G#m]me,
Now it's histo[C#]ry.

{c: Verse 2}
I've played [F#]all my cards,
And that's what you've [C#/F]done too.
Nothing more to [G#m]say,
No more ace to [C#]play.

{c: Chorus 1}
The winner takes it [F#]all,
The [A#]loser's [D#m]standing small.
Be[D#]side the victo[G#m]ry,
That's her desti[C#]ny.

{c: Verse 3}
I was in your [F#]arms,
Thinking I be[C#/F]longed there.
I figured it made [G#m]sense,
Building me a [C#]fence.

{c: Verse 4}
Building me a [F#]home,
Thinking I'd be [C#/F]strong there.
But I was a [G#m]fool,
Playing by the [C#]rules.

{c: Chorus 2}
The gods may [F#]throw a dice,
Their [A#]minds as [D#m]cold as ice,
And [D#]someone [G#m]way down here,
Loses someone [C#]dear.

{c: Chorus 3}
The winner takes it [F#]all (takes it all),
The [A#]loser [D#m]has to fall (has to fall).
It's [D#]simple and it's [G#m]plain (it's so plain),
Why should I comp[C#]lain? (Why complain?)

{c: Verse 5}
But tell me, [F#]does she kiss
Like I used to [C#/F]kiss you?
Does it feel the [G#m]same,
When she calls your [C#]name?

{c: Verse 6}
Somewhere [F#]deep inside,
You must know I [C#/F]miss you.
But what can I [G#m]say?
Rules must be o[C#]beyed.

{c: Chorus 4}
The judges [F#]will decide (will decide),
The [A#]likes of [D#m]me abide (me abide),
Spec[D#]tators of the [G#m]show (of the show),
Always staying [C#]low (staying low).

{c: Chorus 5}
The game is [F#]on again (on again),
A [A#]lover [D#m]or a friend (or a friend),
[D#]A big thing or a [G#m]small (big or small),
The winner takes it [C#]all (takes it all)!

{c: Verse 7}
I don't wanna [F#]talk,
If it makes you [C#/F]feel sad,
And I under[G#m]stand
You've come to shake my [C#]hand.

{c: Verse 8}
I apolo[F#]gize
If it makes you [C#/F]feel bad,
Seeing me so [G#m]tense,
No self-confi[C#]dence.
But you see...

{c: Outro}
The winner [F#]takes it all!    [A#]      [D#m]
The [D#]winner [G#m]takes it all!    [C#]

[F#]So the winn[A#]er [D#m]takes it all,    [D#]
[G#m]And the loser [C#]has to fall.

[F#]Throw the dice,    [A#]
[D#m]Cold as ice,    [D#]
[G#m]Way down here,
[C#]Someone dear.

[F#]Takes it all,    [A#]
[D#m]Has to fall,    [D#]
[G#m]And it's plain,
[C#]Why complain?
