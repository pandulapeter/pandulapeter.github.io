{c: Intro}

{c: Verse 1}
They like to get you in a compromising position,
Well, they like to get you there and smile in your face.
Yeah, they think they're so cute when they got you in that condition,
But I think it's a total disgrace!

{c: Chorus}
And I say, I fight authority, authority always wins,
Well, I fight authority, authority always wins.
Well, I've been doing it since I was a young kid, and I come out grinnin',
Well, I fight authority, authority always wins. Oh yeah!

{c: Bridge 1}

{c: Verse 2}
I call up my preacher, I say, "Give me strength for round 5",
He said, "You don't need no strength, you need to grow up son".
I said, "Growin' up leads to growin' old and then to dyin',
Oh, and dyin' to me don't sound like all that much fun".

{c: Chorus}
And so I'll say, I fight authority, authority always wins,
Well, I fight authority, authority always wins.
Well, I've been doing it since I was a young kid, I come out grinnin',
Well, I fight authority, authority always wins.

{c: Solo}

{c: Bridge 2}
I say oh no, no no,
I say oh no, no no,
I say oh no, no no no,

{c: Chorus}
I fight authority, authority always wins,
I fight authority, authority always wins (kick it in)!
I've been doing it since I was a young kid and I come out grinnin',
Well, I fight authority, authority always wins.

{c: Chorus}
Well, I fight authority, authority always wins,
Well, I fight authority, authority always wins.
I've been doing it since I was a young kid and I come out grinnin',
Well, I fight authority, authority always wins.

{c: Chorus}
So I said I fight authority, authority always wins (Oh no),
Well I fight authority, authority always wins (Oh no no).
Well I've been doing it since I was a young kid (Oh no) and I come out grinnin' (Oh no),
Well I fight authority, authority always wins.
