{c: Verse 1}
I don't [Cm]need your [Fm]sympathy,
There's [A#]nothing you can say or [D#]do for me.
And I [Cm]don't want a [Fm]miracle,
[A#]You'll never [D#]change for no one.

{c: Pre-Chorus 1}
[Cm]I hear your [Fm]reasons why,
[A#]Where did you [D#]sleep last night?
[Cm]And was she [Fm]worth it?
[Fm]Was she [G]worth it?
[Cm/G]

{c: Chorus}
'Cause I'm [Dm]strong enough,
To [Gm]live without you,
[C]Strong enough,
And [F]I quit crying [Dm]long enough,
Now I'm [Gm]strong enough to [C]know,
[A]You gotta go.

{c: Chorus}
There's no [Dm]more to say,
So [Gm]save your breath,
And then [C]walk away,
No [F]matter what I [Dm]hear you say,
I'm [Gm]strong enough to [C]know,
[A]You gotta go.

{c: Verse 2}
So you [Dm]feel mis[Gm]understood,
[C]Baby, have I got [F]news for you.
On being [Dm]used, I could [Gm]write the book,
[C]You don't want to [F]hear about it.

{c: Pre-Chorus 2}
'Cause [Dm]I've been [Gm]losing sleep,
[C]You've been [F]going cheap.
[Dm]She ain't worth [Gm]half of me, it's [C]true,
[A]I'm telling you.

{c: Chorus}
That I'm [Dm]strong enough,
To [Gm]live without you,
[C]Strong enough,
And [F]I quit crying [Dm]long enough,
Now I'm [Gm]strong enough to [C]know,
[A]You gotta go.

[Dm]        [Gm]        [C]        [A]

{c: Pre-Chorus 3}
[Dm]Come hell or [Gm]waters high,
[C]You'll never [F]see me cry.
[Dm]This is our [Gm]last goodbye, it's [C]true,
[A]I'm telling you.

{c: Chorus}
Now I'm [Em]strong enough,
To [Am]live without you,
[D]Strong enough,
And [G]I quit crying [Em]long enough,
Now I'm [Am]strong enough to [D]know,
[B]You gotta go.

{c: Chorus}
There's [Em]no more to say,
So [Am]save your breath,
And then [D]walk away,

I'm [Am]strong enough to [D]know,
[B]You gotta go.

[Em]        [Am]         [D]        [G]
[Em]        [Am]         [D]        [B]

{c: Chorus}
Now I'm [Em]strong enough,
To [Am]live without you,
[D]Strong enough,
And [G]I quit crying [Em]long enough,
Now I'm [Am]strong enough to [D]know,
[B]You gotta go.

{c: Chorus}
There's [Em]no more to say,
So [Am]save your breath,
And then [D]walk away,
No [G]matter what I [Em]hear you say,
I'm [Am]strong enough to [D]know,
[B]You gotta go.
