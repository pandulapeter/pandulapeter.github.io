I get up and nothin' gets me down,
You got it tough, I've seen the toughest around!

{c: Verse 2}
And I know, baby, just how you feel,
You got to roll with the punches and get to what's real!

{c: Pre-Chorus}
Ah, can't you see me standin' here?
I got my back against the record machine.
I ain't the worst that you've seen,
Ah, can't you see what I mean?

Ah, might as well jump (jump),
Might as well jump!
Go ahead and jump (jump),
Go ahead and jump!

Ow, oh, hey, you, who said that? Baby, how you been?
You say you don't know, you won't know until you begin!

So can't ya see me standing here?
I got my back against the record machine.
I ain't the worst that you've seen,

Might as well jump (jump),
Go ahead and jump!
Jump!
