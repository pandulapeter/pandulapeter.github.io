[A]      [Bm]      [D]      [A]
[A]      [Bm]      [D]      [A]

{c: Verse 1}
[A]Twenty-five years and my life is still
[Bm]Trying to get up that great big hill of [D]hope
For a desti[A]nation.

{c: Verse 2}
I [A]realized quickly when I knew I should
That the [Bm]world was made up of this brotherhood of [D]man,
For whatever that [A]means.

{c: Bridge 1}
And so I [A]cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed
Just to [Bm]get it all out what's in my head, and I,[D]
I am feeling a little pe[A]culiar.
And so I [A]wake in the morning and I step outside,
And I [Bm]take a deep breath, and I get real high,
And I [D]scream from the top of my lungs what's going [A]on?

{c: Chorus}
And I say, [A]hey yeah yeah yeah, [Bm]hey yeah yeah
I said [D]hey, what's going [A]on?
And I say, [A]hey yeah yeah yeah, [Bm]hey yeah yeah
I said [D]hey, what's going [A]on?

{c: Bridge 2}
[A]      [Bm]      [D]      [A]

{c: Verse 3}
And I [A]try,
Oh my God do I [Bm]try, I try all the [D]time,
In this insti[A]tution.

{c: Verse 4}
And I [A]pray,
Oh my God do I [Bm]pray, I pray every single [D]day,
For a revo[A]lution.

{c: Bridge 1}
And so I [A]cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed
Just to [Bm]get it all out what's in my head, and I,[D]
I am feeling a little pe[A]culiar.
And so I [A]wake in the morning and I step outside,
And I [Bm]take a deep breath, and I get real high,
And I [D]scream from the top of my lungs what's going [A]on?

{c: Chorus}
And I say, [A]hey yeah yeah yeah, [Bm]hey yeah yeah
I said [D]hey, what's going [A]on?
And I say, [A]hey yeah yeah yeah, [Bm]hey yeah yeah
I said [D]hey, what's going [A]on?

{c: Chorus}
And I say, [A]hey yeah yeah yeah, [Bm]hey yeah yeah
I said [D]hey, what's going [A]on?
And I say, [A]hey yeah yeah yeah, [Bm]hey yeah yeah
I said [D]hey, what's going [A]on?
