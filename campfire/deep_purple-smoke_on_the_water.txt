{c: Intro}

{c: Verse 1}
We all came out to Montreux,
On the Lake Geneva shoreline,
To make records with a mobile, yeah,
We didn't have much time.

{c: Verse 2}
Frank Zappa and the Mothers,
Were at the best place around.
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground.

{c: Chorus}
Smoke on the water, a fire in the sky!
Smoke on the water!

{c: Bridge}

{c: Verse 3}
They burned down the gambling house,
It died with an awful sound.
Funky Claude was running in and out,
Pulling kids out of ground.

{c: Verse 4}
When it all was over,
We had to find another place.
Swiss time was running out,
It seemed that we would lose the race.

{c: Chorus}
Smoke on the water, a fire in the sky!
Smoke on the water!

{c: Bridge}

{c: Solo}

{c: Bridge}

{c: Verse 5}
We ended up at the Grand Hotel,
It was empty, cold and bare.
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there.

{c: Verse 6}
With a few red lights and a few old beds,
We made a place to sweat.
No matter what we get out of this.
I know, I know we'll never forget.

{c: Chorus}
Smoke on the water, a fire in the sky!
Smoke on the water!

{c: Bridge}
