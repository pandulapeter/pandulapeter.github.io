{c: Intro}

{c: Verse 1}
Well you're the real tough cookie with a long history
Of breaking little hearts like the one in me.
That's okay, let's see how you do it,
Put up you dukes, let's get down to it!

{c: Chorus}
Hit me with your best shot,
Why don't you hit me with your best shot?
Hit me with your best shot,
Fire away!

{c: Verse 2}
You come on with it, come on, you don't fight fair,
But that's okay, see if I care!
Knock me down, it's all in vain,
I get right back on my feet again!

{c: Chorus}
Hit me with your best shot,
Why don't you hit me with your best shot?
Hit me with your best shot,
Fire away!

{c: Solo}

{c: Verse 3}
Well you're the real tough cookie with a long history
Of breaking little hearts like the one in me.
Before I put another notch in my lipstick case,
You better make sure you put me in my place!

{c: Bridge}
Hit me with your best shot,
C'mon, hit me with your best shot!
Hit me with your best shot,
Fire away!

{c: Chorus}
Hit me with your best shot,
Why don't you hit me with your best shot?
Hit me with your best shot,
Fire away!
