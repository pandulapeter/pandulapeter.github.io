{c: Bridge 1}
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

{c: Verse 1}
There [Bm]lived a certain man in Russia long ago,
He was [Em]big and strong, in his [F#]eyes a flaming [Bm]glow.
Most [Bm]people looked at him with terror and with fear,
But to [Em]Moscow chicks he was [F#]such a lovely [Bm]dear.

{c: Pre-Chorus 1}
He could preach the Bible like a preacher,
Full of ecstasy and fire.
But he also was the kind of teacher,
Women would desire.

{c: Chorus 1}
[B]Ra-Ra-[D]Rasputin,
[E]Lover of the [B]Russian queen,
[A]There was a [E]cat that [B]really was gone.
[B]Ra-Ra-[D]Rasputin,
[E]Russia's greatest [B]love machine,
[A]It was a [E]shame how [B]he carried on.

{c: Verse 2}
He ruled the Russian land and never mind the Czar,
But the kazachok he danced really wunderbar.
In all affairs of state he was the man to please,
But he was real great when he had a girl to squeeze.

{c: Pre-Chorus 2}
For the queen he was no wheeler dealer,
Though she'd heard the things he'd done.
She believed he was a holy healer,
Who would heal her son.

{c: Chorus 1}
Ra-Ra-Rasputin,
Lover of the Russian queen.
There was a cat that really was gone.
Ra-Ra-Rasputin,
Russia's greatest love machine,
It was a shame how he carried on.

{c: Bridge 2}
But when his drinking and lusting and his hunger for power
Became known to more and more people,
The demands to do something about this outrageous man
Became louder and louder.

{c: Bridge 1}
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

{c: Verse 3}
"This man's just got to go", declared his enemies,
But the ladies begged, "don't you try to do it, please".
No doubt this Rasputin had lots of hidden charms,
Though he was a brute, they just fell into his arms.

{c: Pre-Chorus 3}
Then one night some men of higher standing
Set a trap, they're not to blame,
"Come to visit us", they kept demanding
And he really came.

{c: Chorus 2}
Ra-Ra-Rasputin,
Lover of the Russian queen,
They put some poison into his wine.
Ra-Ra-Rasputin,
Russia's greatest love machine,
He drank it all and said, "I feel fine".

{c: Chorus 3}
Ra-Ra-Rasputin,
Lover of the Russian queen,
They didn't quit, they wanted his head.
Ra-Ra-Rasputin,
Russia's greatest love machine,
And so they shot him 'til he was dead.

{c: Outro}
Oh, those Russians...
