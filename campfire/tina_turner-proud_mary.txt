{c: Intro}
[D]
You know, every now and then I think you might like to hear something from us nice and easy.
([D]Left a good job down in the city) But there's just one thing: you see, we never ever do nothing
([D]Workin' for the man every night and day) Nice, easy.
([D]But I never lost one minute of sleepin') We always do it nice and rough.
([D]Worryin' 'bout the way that things might have been) So we're gonna take the beginning of this song,
And do it easy.
([D]Big wheel keep on turnin') But then we're gonna do the finish rough.
([D]Proud Mary keep on burnin') This is the way we do "Proud Mary".
And we're [D]rolling (ooh), rolling (ooh), rolling on the river.
Listen to the story!
