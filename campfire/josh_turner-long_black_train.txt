{c: Verse 1}
There's a [A#]long black train coming down the line,
[A#]Feeding off the souls that are [Gm]lost and [A#]cryin'.
[A#]Rails of sin only evil remains,
[A#]Watch out brother for that [F]long black [A#]train.

{c: Verse 2}
[A#]Look to the heavens, you can look to the skies,
[A#]You can find redemption staring [Gm]back into your [A#]eyes.
[A#]There is protection and there is peace the same,
[A#]Burn in your ticket for that [F]long black [A#]train.

{c: Chorus}
'Cause there's [A#]victory in the Lord I say,
[A#]Victory in the [F]Lord.
[Gm]Cling to the [A#]Father and his [D#]holy [A#]name,
And [Gm]don't go [A#]riding on that [F]long black [A#]train.

{c: Verse 3}
There's an [A#]engineer on that long black train,
[A#]Making you wonder if your [Gm]ride is worth the [A#]pain,
[A#]He's just waitin on your heart to say,
"[A#]Let me ride on that [F]long black [A#]train".

{c: Chorus}
But you know there's [A#]victory in the Lord I say,
[A#]Victory in the [F]Lord.
[Gm]Cling to the [A#]Father and his [D#]holy [A#]name,
And [Gm]don't go [A#]riding on that [F]long black [A#]train.

{c: Verse 4}
Well [A#]I can hear the whistle from a mile away,
It [A#]sounds so good, but I [Gm]must stay a[A#]way.
That [A#]train is a beauty making everybody stare,
But its [A#]only destination is the [F]middle of no[A#]where.

{c: Chorus}
But you know there's [A#]victory in the Lord I say,
[A#]Victory in the [F]Lord.
[Gm]Cling to the [A#]Father and his [D#]holy [A#]name,
And [Gm]don't go [A#]riding on that [F]long black [A#]train.

{c: Outro}
I said [Gm]cling to the [A#]Father and his [D#]holy [A#]name,
And [Gm]don't go [A#]riding on that [F]long black [A#]train.
Yes [Gm]watch out [A#]brother for that [F]long black [A#]train,
The [Gm]devil's [A#]ridin' that [F]long black [A#]train.
