{c: Verse 1}
The other [F]night, dear, as I lay sleeping,
I dreamed I [A#]held you in my [F]arms,
But when I a[A#]woke, dear, I was mis[F]taken,
And I [F]hung my [C7]head and I [F]cried.

{c: Chorus}
You are my [F]sunshine, my only sunshine,
You make me [A#]happy when skies are [F]grey.
You'll never [A#]know, dear, how much I [F]love you,
Please don't [F]take my [C7]sunshine a[F]way.

{c: Verse 2}
I'll always [F]love you and make you happy,
If you will o[A#]nly say the [F]same,
But if you [A#]leave me to love a[F]nother,
You'll reg[F]ret it [C7]all some [F]day.

You are my [F]sunshine, my only sunshine,
You make me [A#]happy when skies are [F]grey.

You told me [F]once, dear, you really loved me,
And no one [A#]else could come bet[F]ween,
But now you've [A#]left me and love a[F]nother,
You have [F]shattered [C7]all my [F]dreams.
