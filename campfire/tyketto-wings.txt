[Asus2]

{c: Verse 1}
[C#m]Falling so [E]hard for you [B]woman,
Would you [A]say that [B]love's a [C#m]crime.
[C#m]Jury can [E]call me in[B]guilty,
But I wan[B]t w[A#]hat's [Asus2]mine!          [B]

{c: Verse 2}
And now I'm [C#m]crying [E]out in [B]anger,
The night has [A]taken y[B]ou aw[C#m]ay.
[C#m]Filin' the [E]sins of a[B]nother
Can lock[B] you[A#] a[Asus2]way.          [B]

{c: Pre-Chorus}
And you can [Asus2]knock on [C#m]any [B]door,
From [F#m]now until e[A]terni[B]ty,
And you can [Asus2]keep on [C#m]lookin' [B]anywhere,
You won't [F#m]find another [A]man like [B]me.

{c: Chorus 1}
If I only had the [E]wings to fly,
Leave the chains of [C#m]love below,
Take my heart up [Asus2]in the sky,
I would never let you [B]go!

{c: Verse 3}
[C#m]Cuts like a [E]knife to re[B]member,
Touch is [A]burnin' [B]skin to [C#m]skin.
The [C#m]sweat on our [E]bodies [B]steamin'
The love [B]that [A#]I'm [Asus2]in.          [B]

{c: Pre-Chorus}
And you can [Asus2]knock on [C#m]any [B]door,
From [F#m]now until e[A]terni[B]ty,
And you can [Asus2]keep on [C#m]lookin' [B]anywhere,
You won't [F#m]find another [A]man like [B]me.

{c: Chorus 1}
If I only had the [E]wings to fly,
Leave the chains of [C#m]love below,
Take my heart up [Asus2]in the sky,
I would never let you [B]go!

{c: Chorus 2}
If I could hear the thunder [E]in your heart,
I know my love would [C#m]light the sky.
I could do [Asus2]anything
If I [B]had the wings to [C#m]fly.

[C#m]Give me your [E]all and [B]nothing,
And drive[B] me[A#] a[Asus2]way!

If I only had the [C#m]wings,
I'd fly back to your [Asus2]side,
Make you my [B]own, never never let you go!

The thunder's in the [Asus2]sky,
If I had the wings to [E]fly.
