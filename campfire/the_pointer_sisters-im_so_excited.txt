{c: Intro}
[Gm]            [Cm7]            [D#]            [A#sus4]        [A#]
[Gm]            [Cm7]            [D#]            [A#sus4]        [A#]

{c: Verse 1}
To[Gm]night's the night we're gonna make it [Cm7]happen,
To[D#]night we'll put all other things a[A#sus4]side.          [A#]
Give [Gm]in this time and show me some a[Cm7]ffection,
We're [D#]goin' for those pleasures in the [A#sus4]night.          [A#]

{c: Pre-Chorus}
I want to [Am]love you, feel you,
[Gm]Wrap myself a[Dm7]round you!
I want to [Am]squeeze you, please you,
I [Gm]just can't get enough!
And if you [Cm]move real [Dm]slow, I'll let it [F]go!

{c: Chorus}
I'm so ex[Gm]cited, and I just can't [D#]hide it,
[D#]I'm about to lose con[F]trol and I think I [Gm]like it!
I'm so ex[Gm]cited, and I just can't [D#]hide it,
And [D#]I know, I know, I [F]know, I know, I know I [Gm]want you!

{c: Verse 2}
And we [Gm]shouldn't even think about to[Cm7]morrow,
Sweet [D#]memories will last a long, long [A#sus4]time.          [A#]
And we'll [Gm]have a good time, baby, don't you [Cm7]worry,
And if [D#]we're still playin' around, boy, that's just [A#sus4]fine.          [A#]

{c: Chorus}
Let's get ex[Gm]cited, we just can't [D#]hide it,
[D#]I'm about to lose cont[F]rol and I think I [Gm]like it!
I'm so ex[Gm]cited, and I just can't [D#]hide it,
And [D#]I know, I know, I [F]know, I know, I know I [Gm]want you!

{c: Pre-Chorus}
Oh boy, I want to [Am]love you, feel you,
[Gm]Wrap myself a[Dm7]round you!
I want to [Am]squeeze you, please you,
I [Gm]just can't get enough!
And if you [Cm]move real [Dm]slow, I'll let it [F]go!

And [D#]I know, I know, I [F]know, I know, I know I [Gm]want you!

{c: Outro}
I'm so ex[Gm]cited (look what you do to me), I just can't [D#]hide it (you got me burning up),
[D#]I'm about to lose con[F]trol and I think I [Gm]like it, yeah!
I'm so ex[Gm]cited (how did you get to me? [D#]I've got to give it up),
[D#]Oh ([F]I know, I know I [Gm]want you)!
I'm so ex[Gm]cited!
