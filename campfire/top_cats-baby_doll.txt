{c: Intro}
[Am]        [F]        [C]        [E]

{c: Verse 1}
[Am]Cruisin' down the streets at midnight,
[F]Music boppin', ladies rockin',
[C]Dudes and dudettes all over [E]town.

{c: Verse 2}
[Am]Saw this bird walkin' down the pavement,
[F]Traffic stoppin', fellas droppin',
[C]She just kept walkin' straight on [E]by.

{c: Pre-Chorus 1}
And I [F]realised she's all I'm missin',
I [Dm]pulled my wheels aside,
And with a [Am]smile I rolled my window [E]down.

{c: Chorus}
Baby [Am]doll,
You need some rock 'n' [F]roll,
You need someone to [C]hold you on a cold and lonesome [E]night!
Baby [Am]doll, doll, doll, rock 'n' [F]roll, roll, roll,
Over [C]here, now bring it, bring it over [E]here,
Oh, baby [Am]doll!       [F]        [C]        [E]

{c: Verse 3}
[-]Don't be cruel, don't leave me hangin',
[F]On a wire, my heart's on fire,
[C]Don't make me beg now pretty [E]please.

{c: Verse 4}
[Am]Streets look good when you're in the front seat,
[F]Motor runnin', bird is hummin',
[C]Right here beside me at the [E]wheel.

{c: Pre-Chorus 2}
With her [F]by my side nothing's missing,
I [Dm]turn my wheels ahead,
And with a [Am]smile I press my right foot [E]down.

{c: Chorus}
Baby [Am]doll,
You need some rock 'n' [F]roll,
You need someone to [C]hold you on a cold and lonesome [E]night!
Baby [Am]doll, doll, doll, rock 'n' [F]roll, roll, roll,
Over [C]here, now bring it, bring it over [E]here!

{c: Bridge}
[F]Baby, my ride is gonna take you high,
Straight [Dm]down Rocky Road and then we'll hit the sky,
To[Am]night, oh yes to[E]night.
[F]Gonna steer us steady down Lovers Lane,
[Dm]Up to Seventh Heaven and then back again,
[F]Up to Seventh Heaven and then back again to[G]night.

Oh baby doll, doll, doll,
Rock 'n' roll, roll, roll,
Over here now, bring it, bring it over here!

{c: Chorus}
Baby [Am]doll,
You need some rock 'n' [F]roll,
You need someone to [C]hold you on a cold and lonesome [E]night!
Baby [Am]doll, doll, doll, rock 'n' [F]roll, roll, roll,
Over [C]here, now bring it, bring it over [E]here,
Oh, baby [Am]doll!

{c: Outro}
[Am]   My baby [Am]doll!
Oh, baby [Am]doll!
My baby [Am]doll!
