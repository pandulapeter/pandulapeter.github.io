{c: Intro}

{c: Verse 1}
We're gonna blow peoples fucking heads off,
People gonna shit themselves.
Crying out for more, caution wet floor,
This one's going out to the girls.

{c: Verse 2}
Hellbent for denim and leather,
Notoriety and wealth.
After the show, I think we both know,
This fist ain't gonna bump itself.

{c: Pre-Chorus}
We are legends, with a power that you can't deny.
We're immortal, because our songs will never die!

{c: Chorus}
And we're never gonna stop
Shitting out solid gold!
And we're never gonna stop
Shitting out solid gold!

{c: Verse 3}
There's a guy coming down from Sony,
Artist and repertoire.
If he like what he hears in those stupid ears,
I'll buy myself a faster car.

{c: Verse 4}
He's blowing smoke up our arses,
Everything we do is "ace".
He wants to wine and dine us, desperate to sign us,
'Cause we melted his fucking face.

{c: Pre-Chorus}
We are legends, with a power that you can't deny.
We're immortal, because our songs will never die!

{c: Chorus}
And we're never gonna stop
Shitting out solid gold!
And we're never gonna stop
Shitting out solid gold!

{c: Bridge}
Stone cold foxes screaming in the front row,
Sacred promise of fellatio,
Soul that can't be sold,
Lo and behold, behold!

{c: Solo}

{c: Chorus}
And we're never gonna stop
Shitting out solid gold!
And we're never gonna stop
Shitting out solid gold!

{c: Chorus}
And we're never gonna stop
Shitting out solid gold!
And we're never gonna stop
Shitting out solid gold!
