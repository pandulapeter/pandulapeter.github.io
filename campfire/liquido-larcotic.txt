{c: Intro}

{c: Bridge 1}

{c: Verse 1}
So you face it with a smile,
There is no need to cry,
For a trifle's more than this.

{c: Verse 2}
Will you still recall my name?
And the month it all began
Will you release me with a kiss?

{c: Verse 3}
Have I tried to draw the veil?
If I have - how could I fail?
Did I fear the consequence?

{c: Pre-Chorus}
Dazed by careless words,
Cosy in my mind.

{c: Chorus}
I don't mind,
I think so,
I will let you go.

{c: Chorus}
I don't mind,
I think so,
I will let you go.

{c: Verse 4}
Now you shaped that liquid wax,
Fit it out with crater cracks,
Sweet devotion, my delight.

{c: Verse 5}
Oh, you're such a pretty one,
And the naked thrills of flesh and skin
Would tease me through the night.

{c: Verse 6}
Now I hate to leave you bare.
If you need me I'll be there,
Don't you ever let me down.

{c: Pre-Chorus}
Dazed by careless words,
Cosy in my mind.

{c: Chorus}
I don't mind,
I think so,
I will let you go.

{c: Chorus}
I don't mind,
I think so,
I will let you go.

{c: Bridge 2}
And I touched your face,
Narcotic mind from lazed
Mary-Jane.
And I called your name,
Like an addicted to cocaine,
Calls for the stuff he'd rather blame.
And I touched your face,
Narcotic mind from lazed
Mary-Jane.
And I called your name,
My cocaine...

{c: Chorus}
I don't mind,
I think so,
I will let you go.

{c: Chorus}
I don't mind,
I think so,
I will let you go.

{c: Chorus}
I don't mind,
I think so,
I will let you go.

{c: Chorus}
I don't mind,
I think so,
I will let you go.
