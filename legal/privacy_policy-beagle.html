		<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
		<p>By downloading and using Beagle, these terms will automatically apply to you, therefore you should make sure that you read them carefully.</p>
		<p>This application is provided to you by Pandula Péter at no cost and is intended for use as is.</p>
		<h2>General overview</h2>
		<p>This page is used to inform you regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information if anyone decided to use my service.</p>
		<p>If you choose to use my service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The personal information that I collect is used for providing and improving the service and you can opt out of this collection at any time. I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
		<p>The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, which is accessible in the Campfire app, unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.</p>
		<h2>Information collection and use</h2>
		<p>Beagle does not have any data collection solution integrated, as a result, I am not collecting any personally identifiable information on purpose. However, keep in mind that some data collection mechanisms are beyond my control. For instance, just by downloading the application from the Google Play Store, you are automatically sharing some limited usage data and crash logs with me, the developer, as well as Google. You agreed to this when accepting the Play Services license agreement, over which I have no control whatsoever.</p>
		<h2>Children’s privacy</h2>
		<p>These services do not address anyone under the age of 13. I do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided me with personal information, please contact me so that I will be able to do necessary actions.</p>
		<h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
		<p> I may update my Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted.</p>
		<h2>Contact me</h2>
		<p>If you have any questions or suggestions about my Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to <a href="mailto:pandulapeter@gmail.com?Subject=Beagle" target="_top">contact me</a>.</p>
